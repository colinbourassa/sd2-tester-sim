TODO: It seems that some of these requests expect a multi-byte value in response,
while some of them expect only a single byte.

0x31 cmd value codes:
  1E: Intended market? (EUR, US, ...?)
  01: Engagement potentiometer travel (mm)
      Range is 0x0000 (-3.71 mm) to 0x03ff (26.38 mm), 0.03 mm LSB
  02: Potentiometer clutch travel (degrees)
      Range is 0x0000 (-41.75 deg) to 0x03ff (29.79 deg), 0.07 deg LSB
  03: Clutch travel (mm)
      Range is 0x0000 (-2.70 mm) to 0x03ff (33.62 mm), 0.0355 deg LSB
  04: Clutch travel reference (mm)
      Range is 0x0000 (-2.70 mm) to 0x03ff (33.62 mm), 0.0355 deg LSB
  05: Throttle potentiometer 
      Range is 0x0000 to 0x03ff, taken as direct units
  06: Hydraulic circuit pressure (bar)
      Range is 0x0000 (-12.00 bar) to 0x03ff (90.30 bar), 0.10 bar LSB
  07: Water temperature (deg C)
      Range is 0x0000 to 0x2000, BCD degrees (e.g. 0x1253 is 125.3 deg)
  08: Battery voltage (V)
      2.44V LSB
  09: Lever status
      0x0400: Neutral
  10: Engine RPM
      1 RPM LSB
  11: Gearbox primary angle speed
      1 RPM LSB
  13: Gear engaged
      Most values show "NEUTRAL"
  14: Bitfield: (TODO: single byte response?)
      bit 8: Brake SW status (0: on, 1: off)
      bit 9: Driver side door status (0: off, 1: on)
      bit 10: Key input condition (0: off, 1: on)
      bit 11: Startup input status (0: off, 1: on)
      bit 12: Auto SW status (0: off, 1: on)
      bit 13: Sport SW status (0: off, 1: on)
      bit 14: Low grip SW status (0: off, 1: on)
  15: SV current control for uneven (odd?) gear engagement
      Only the high byte is checked; low byte is ignored -- TODO: single byte response?
      High byte LSB is 9.8 mA
  16: SV current control for even gear engagement
      Only the high byte is checked; low byte is ignored -- TODO: single byte response?
      High byte LSB is 9.8 mA
  20: Pump relay control
      If any of the lower 4 bits in the high byte (first byte in the reply msg) are set,
      this shows as RELAY ON.
  21: Effective torque Motronic
      16-bit value, 1 Nm LSB
