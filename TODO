BMOT0119:
Verify the number of bytes expected in reply from the ECU after the slow init
address is sent. This expected byte count should be in the 11h command. It should
probably be 03 to reflect 55 00 81, in spite of the config file having a six-byte
sequence. (This six byte sequence is, probably erroneously, `55 4C 83 04 13 3B`.)

BANT0086:
WSDC32 sends commands like 52 FE 01 to the ECU (via msg 13h) and expects exactly
one additional byte in the reply from the ECU. Only the last byte of the ECU's
reply is forwarded by the Tester back to WSDC32, suggesting that this protocol
provides one-byte-at-a-time read access. The protocol otherwise looks a bit lik
the Toshiba Inverter Protocol, which uses a command byte of 52h to request reading
RAM. In the Toshiba documentation, the byte pair FE 01 is referred to as a
"communication number", and this seems to take the role of an address. Toshiba
communication numbers are divided into different regions, with FE xx and FF xx
usually being reserved for parameters in RAM.

This one looks like FIAT/Marelli 1AF, which we had already determined by looking
at the code in the A.out .ecu file. The extra byte (value 00) after 13 and before
the start of the ID info request (04 51 00 00 55) is a WSDC32 protocol status
byte, and we should probably set it to 01 when replying from the simulator.
