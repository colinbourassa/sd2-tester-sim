WSDC32 never gets past "Reading ECU information, please wait...", suggesting that it is waiting for a better reply to the cmd 13 ECU msg payload (at 641.412, above).
It looks like a KWP71 block:
  03: num bytes following
  04: num sequence number (which makes sense, since 01, 02, and 03 were used by the initial
                           ID exchange whose info was sent in the first message above)
  00: block title for requesting ID info
  03: terminator

This one looks like FIAT/Marelli 1AF, which we had already determined by looking
at the code in the A.out .ecu file. The extra byte (value 00) after 13 and before
the start of the ID info request (04 51 00 00 55) is a WSDC32 protocol status
byte, and we should probably set it to 01 when replying from the simulator.
