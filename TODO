=== BANT0086 ===
When commands are sent to the ECU using this protocol, the reponse includes a
single byte of data.

Command 52h is a read request, and always seems to be followed by an address and
what looks to be a byte count. When issued by the SD2, the byte count is always
01, so the code running in the Tester only needs to transfer the last byte of
the ECU's reply back to WSDC32.

52 FE 01 : Read one byte at location FE
52 FF 01 : Read one byte at location FF

The previous two reads are always the first ones run by the software for BANT0086.
The two returned bytes are taken together as a BCD representation of the
particular model of Bosch alarm module, e.g. 01 72 is VIM172. WSDC32 will change
the particular sequence of subsequent read requests depending on the VIM type.

52 66 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 : Read location 66, but with extra (ignored?) payload bytes

Command 44h is apparently also a Read, but is perhaps reading from a different
address space or device. The following commands apply to VIM172:

44 AA : Read fault code flags
  bit 0: ECU overheating
  bit 3: locking circuit
  bit 4: EEPROM checksum
44 AB : Read more fault code flags
  bit 0: ECU interface
  bit 1: ECU interface
  bit 2: dialogue alarm system / interface ECU
44 96 : Read alarm status
  (00: disarmed, 01: immobilized, 02: armed, 03: in alarm, 04: panic, 05: not operating)
44 C3 : Read sensor states
  bit 0: doors status (0: closed, 1: open)
  bit 1: front lid (0: closed, 1: open)
  bit 2: rear lid (0: closed, 1: open)
  bit 5: inclination sensor (0: not activated, 1: activated)
  bit 7: ignition (0: off, 1: on)

This one looks like FIAT/Marelli 1AF, which we had already determined by looking
at the code in the A.out .ecu file. The extra byte (value 00) after 13 and before
the start of the ID info request (04 51 00 00 55) is a WSDC32 protocol status
byte, and we should probably set it to 01 when replying from the simulator.
